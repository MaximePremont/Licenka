### Problem

*What problem does your project solve? How does it fit into the theme "Building a Decentralized Future"?*

### Solution

*How did you resolve this issue? What technologies did you use? What was your biggest technical challenge and how does your solution solve it?*

### Facility

*Explain, step-by-step, how someone can install your project and use it. The jury will mainly use MacOS, Ubuntu, Android, and iOS. Setting up a docker/docker-compose is a good idea to allow someone to test the project easily.*
